ABOUT
=====

This is the Ensymble developer utilities for Symbian OS(TM), a 
collection of Python® modules and command line programs for Symbian OS 
[1] software development.

This is a preview release with limited functionality. For now, Ensymble 
only supports installation package (SIS) generation for "Python for S60" 
scripts. Support for other tasks will follow.

Ensymble aims to provide a cross-platform, open-source way to do Symbian 
OS software development, supporting Symbian OS versions 9.1 and later. 
The original tools by Symbian are closed source and only available for 
the Windows® operating system.

Symbian OS is the operating system used by Nokia [2] in some of its 
mobile phones [3]. Other manufacturers have also licensed Symbian OS. 
Python for S60 [4] is a port of the popular Python programming language 
[5] to a Nokia phone platform called S60® [6]. Before November 2005, S60 
was called Series 60.


VERSION COMPATIBILITY
=====================

Ensymble targets Symbian OS v9.1 and later. For Nokia phones, this 
means S60 3rd Edition. 1st and 2nd Edition phones are not directly 
supported by Ensymble.

The py2sis command of the Ensymble command line tool produces 
installation packages (SIS) for Python for S60 version 1.3.8 and later. 
This was the first publicly released version of Python for S60 which 
was compatible with S60 3rd Edition. See py2sisng [7] for a 
cross-platform version of py2sis, compatible with S60 1st and 2nd 
Edition.

Ensymble is written in Python. Python v2.2 or newer is required, as 
older versions lack necessary language features. Ensymble has been 
tested on the following systems:

 * Debian GNU/Linux Sid (i386) with Python v2.3.5 and v2.4.4c0
 * Red Hat Linux release 9 (i386) with Python v2.2.2
 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 3 (i386) with Python v2.2.3
 * Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS release 4 (i386) with Python v2.3.4
 * Apple OS X Tiger (G4) with Python v2.3.5
 * Microsoft Windows XP, SP2 with Python v2.5


INSTALLATION
============

Care has been taken to ensure that minimum amount of extra software is 
needed to run Ensymble. A working installation of Python is required 
(see VERSION COMPATIBILITY above). In addition, the OpenSSL command 
line tool [8] is required for installation package (SIS) generation. 
Any recent version will do, and can usually be found pre-installed. For 
Windows, the Stunnel OpenSSL binaries [9] are recommended, but any 
other binaries will do as well.

For convenience, a regular Ensymble installation packs everything 
together in one file using the nifty squeeze utility [10] by Fredrik 
Lundh. Pre-squeezed files for various Python versions may be downloaded 
from the Ensymble home page. These files are ready to use, no unpacking 
is necessary.

For Unix-like systems, there is a simple installation script which 
squeezes all the required files together and copies the resulting 
package to the user's bin-directory. The directory must exist already:

----
$ ./install.sh ~/bin
----

If the installation goes through without errors, the Ensymble command 
line tool "ensymble.py" is now ready for use, provided that the user's 
bin-directory can be found in command search path.


USAGE
=====

The Ensymble command line tool provides access to most Ensymble 
functionality. Its usage is in basic form ("$" is the Unix command 
prompt):

----
$ ensymble.py command options...
----

, where "command" is the command to be executed and "options" are the 
command specific options. Running ensymble.py without arguments will 
list all the available commands. Options for the command can be found 
using the "--help" (or "-h") option:

----
$ ensymble.py version -h
Ensymble developer utilities for Symbian OS(TM)

usage: ensymble.py version

Print Ensymble version.
----

Only one useful command is available in this preview release: The 
"py2sis" command is used to pack a Python for S60 script and its 
auxiliary files (if any), to a Symbian installation package (SIS). In 
the simplest form it is used like this:

----
$ ensymble.py py2sis --uid=0xf2345678 myprog.py
----

This generates a SIS file called "myprog_v1_0_0.sis" in current working 
directory. The SIS file can then be uploaded to a S60 3rd Edition phone.

Note: use a real UID instead of the dummy one given above. UIDs can be 
ordered from Symbian Signed [11]. If you have already ordered UIDs for 
1st or 2nd Edition phones, to use these UIDs in 3rd Edition phones the 
first hex digit (a "1") needs to be changed to an "f".

The "py2sis" command has a lot of options. This document does not yet 
cover them. For details, see the py2sisng [7] README file. Many of the 
options work identically to py2sisng, but there are some changes:

 * 1st and 2nd Edition phones are not supported.
 * UIDs begin with an "f" (see above).
 * Icon is an SVG-T file instead of an MBM file (a default icon is provided).
 * A certificate is always needed (a default built-in one is provided, though).
 * Capabilities need to be set according to program needs (the "--caps" opt.).
 * Version string has an optional third number, the build.

Note about security: The private key of the certificate is saved 
unencrypted to a temporary file and could be recovered by others. Keep 
this in mind when working with SIS certificates.
